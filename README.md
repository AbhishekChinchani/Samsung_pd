# Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
	 
 **RTL**: It is a design abstraction that models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the data flow between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. In RTL code we write code for combinational and sequential circuits like that of HDL, and VHDL.

 
**Testbench**: It is a program written in any language for the purposes of exercising and verifying the functional correctness of the hardware model as coded. We write this testbench in Verilog. Using this testbench we apply a stimulus to the RTL Design and verify its functionality by checking the output.

**Simulator**: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs. The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.  

</details>	
 <details>
 <summary>Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave</summary>

 We performed all the lab examples on the Linux operating system.

 **Iverilog**: Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language compiler that generates netlists in the desired format (EDIF). It supports the 1995, 2001, and 2005 versions of the standard, portions of SystemVerilog, and some extensions.

 **Gtkwave**: GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix, Win32, and Mac OSX which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

 We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice. 

 Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog. 
 
 The syntax of the code is: iverilog RTL_design_code Testbench

 <summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

 **Synthesis**: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

 **Yosys** : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

**Verification of synthesized design** : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

**Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells** :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power. Narrow transistors are other way around. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit. Keeping in view of previous observations of faster vs slower cells,to avoid hold time violations, larger circuits, sluggish circuits, we offer guidance to synthesizer in the form of Constraints.

<summary>Labs on Yosys </summary>
 We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX. 
 
 **Procedure** : First we need to read the liberty file using the code
 
 **read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 Then we need read the RTL Design code

 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 After this we need to perform synthesis 

 **synth -top <instance_name>**
 
 generating netlist

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form using the **show** command

# Day-2-Introduction to Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and flip flop coding 

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to timing libraries</summary>

 **Timing File** consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was  **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8**, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical, temperature is 25C, and 1v8 represents the voltage.

Below is the screenshot of a standard library file

<img width = "1085" alt="std_lib" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/8cc214f938b327466e90dde958d486b2d36f7b9d/day%232/lib_file.png">

The timing File also consists of the technology used for standard cells as in the above example it is **CMOS**, it also specifies the delay model, unit of time, unit of voltage, unit of resistance, and many other units. 

For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters are mentioned. For example, consider the below screenshot the gate mentioned in the screenshot consists of 5 inputs so there will be 2^5 i.e 32 combinations, and for all the combinations power, delay, value, and all the features are mentioned in it.

<img  width="1085" alt="std_lib" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/522961b79bd941674795678a161f1ee5465e484c/day%232/a21110.png">

The timing file consists of many different variations of the same gate cells.

Below image shows the comparison of the power consumption of different flavours of the same gate

 <summary>Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis</summary>
	
 **Hierarchical synthesis** : The basic flow of hierarchical design is simple… Dividing a design into multiple blocks (sometimes referred to as sub-chips, sub-blocks, modules, hierarchical blocks, etc.). Designers can work on the blocks separately and in parallel from RTL through physical implementation. Hierarchial design has blocks, subblocks in an hierarchy.

 Consider a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of a **and** gate and other of a **or** gate. Below is the RTL Design code of multimodule.
 


```ruby
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a&b;
endmodule


module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
wire net1;
sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
```
The Schmetic of the multiple  model is as shown in the below figure.
<img  width="1085" alt="hand_writ_ckt" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/0c2e5b9a02719702743f4bf1683199e4fa698174/day%232/multi.jpg">

When we perform synthesis in yosys it generates the following schematic instead of the  above  schematic
<img  width="1085" alt="hier" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/hier_sch.png">

The yosys considers the module hierarchy and does mapping according to the instantiation.The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules

```ruby
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	  input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	  wire net1;
	 output y;
  sub_module1 u1 (.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1) );
  sub_module2 u2 (.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
 wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
 input a;
 input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (.A(_1_),.B(_0_),.X(_2_));
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
input a;
input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _3_ (.A(_1_),.SLEEP(_0_),.X(_2_) );
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
In the netlist we can observe that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are getting created i.e submodules are getting instanstiated not the gate cells


**Flat synthesis** : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened  out and there is a single module in the netlist i.e the gates are instantiated directly instead of submodules. We apply flat synthesis on the same  design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows

**read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 **synth -top <instance_name>**

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
 **flatten**

**write_verilog -noattr <File_name>**

The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist is shown in the below image , Here submodules u1 and u2 are flattened 
<img  width="1085" alt="hier" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/flat_sch.png">

The netlist code of the flattened synthesis is as follows
```ruby

module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	 wire _0_;
	 wire _1_;
	 wire _2_;
	 wire _3_;
	 wire _4_;
	 wire _5_;
	 input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	 wire net1;
	 wire \u1.a ;
	 wire \u1.b ;
	 wire \u1.y ;
	 wire \u2.a ;
	 wire \u2.b ;
	 wire \u2.y ;
	output y;
	 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _6_ (
	  .A(_1_),
	 .B(_0_),
	 .X(_2_)
	);
	 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _7_ (
	  .A(_4_),
	  .SLEEP(_3_),
	  .X(_5_)
	 );
	 assign _4_ = \u2.b ;
	 assign _3_ = \u2.a ;
	 assign \u2.y  = _5_;
	 assign \u2.a  = net1;
	 assign \u2.b  = c;
	 assign y = \u2.y ;
	 assign _1_ = \u1.b ;
	 assign _0_ = \u1.a ;
	 assign \u1.y  = _2_;
	 assign \u1.a  = a;
	 assign \u1.b  = b;
	 assign net1 = \u1.y ;
	endmodule
```
We can see that there is a single module which consist of the gate level instantion of the two submodules .


Performing Synthesis at sub_module level is one of the good practises for the massive designs as it simplifies the debugging process . It is also helpful in cases where there many instances of the same module , Instead of synthesizing all the instances we can synthesize one and duplicate it for others and stitch them together. Here is the synthesized circuit and netlist image of the sub_module1 

<img  width="1085" alt="sub_module1" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/sub_module1_sch.png">

 <summary>Flop coding</summary>

 **Flop**: They are digital electronic circuits that are used to store information in bits as they have two stable states.Even though the input is not stable it gives stable output.
 
 **Why Flop**
 
 In a combinational circuit, the output changes after the propagation delay of the circuit once inputs are changed. During the propagation of data, if there are different paths with different propagation delays, there might be a chance of getting a *glitch* at the output. *glitch* is a signal value pulse that occurs when a logic level changes two or more times over a short period.

If there are multiple combinational circuits in the design, the occurances of glitches are more thereby making the output unstable.
To curb this drawback, we are going for flops to store the data from the cominational circuits. When a flop is used, the output of combinational circuit is stored in it and it is propagated only at the posedge or negedge of the clock so that the next combinational circuit gets a glitch free input thereby stabilising the output.

We use initialize signals or control pins called set and reset on a flop to initialize the flop, other wise a garbage value to sent out to the next combinational circuit.

**Asynchronous Reset D Flop**

Here the output signal goes low when the reset signal is high , it does not wait for the clock's edge(positive or negative edge ).i.e irrespective of the clock output changes

RTL Design code of positive edge trigerred asynchronous reset D Flop
```ruby
 module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
	begin
		if(async_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else	
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule

<summary>Optimisation Techniques</summary>

There many special cases where we don't need any additional hardwares to implement the circuit. For Example consider a case where 3 bit number is multiplied by 2 in this case we dont need any additional hardware and only needs connecting bits to the output and grounding the LSB bit,same is realized by yosys.
```ruby
module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2;
endmodule
```
When it comes to multiplying with the powers of 2 it justs need shifting as shown in the below image

 # Day-3-Combinational and sequential logic optimizations 

 <details>
 <summary>Combinational Logic Optimization with examples</summary>

 **Combinational Logic Optimization** squeeze the logic to get most optimized design in terms of area and power. There are various techniques for optimizing the circuit
 
 - constant propagation(Direct propagation)
 - Boolean Logic Optimization(K-Means ,QUine Mckluskey)
   
**Constant Propogation** is an optimization technique used by  synthesis tools to minimize hardware implementation.Constant propagation prevents situations in which values are copied from one place or variable to another only to assign their value to a different variable.

**Example on Constant Propogation** 
<img  width="1085" alt="hand_writ_exam" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/9ee556e759953cfdd337c4c07302f7f415aab031/hand0.jpg">

Consider the above  combinational circuit it consists of and and nor gate, so it requires 6 CMOS transistor to implement , if A is made constant value 0 then A&B will give 0 then 0 and C are given to NOR gate which reduces the expression to C compliment(C`) i.e basically a inverter . By making an input constant we can reduce this combinational circuit to an inverter which can impleneted using only 2 CMOS transistor thus reducing the hardware implementation

**Example for Boolean Logic optimization**
consider a concurrent statement a?(b?c:(c?a:0)):(!c) , this statement is realized using multiple multiplexers. Simplying this equation using boolean reduction techniques we get the output as ~(a^b)

The command to optimize the circuit in yosys is **opt_clean -purge**.

module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);

 <summary>Sequential Logic optimization</summary>

 There are various techniques for Sequential Logic Optimization
 
 - Sequentialal constant propagation
 
 - Advanced 
 	- State Optimization
  
  	- Retiming
   
   	- Sequential Logic cloning

**Sequential Constant Propogation**

Consider a case where asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the timing or circuit.

<img  width="1085" alt="hand_writ_exam" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/9ee556e759953cfdd337c4c07302f7f415aab031/hand1.jpg">

*Advanced*

**State Optimisation**: This is optimisation of unused state. Using this technique we can come up with most optimised state machine.

**Cloning** : It is an optimization technique that duplicates a cell to reduce the load on heavily loaded cell. This technique is usually preffered while performing *PHYSICAL AWARE SYNTHESIS*. Lets consider a flop A which is connected to flop B and flop C through a combination logic. If B and C are placed far from A in the flooerplan, there is a routing path delay. To avoid this, we connect A to two intermediate flops and then from these flops the output is sent to B and C thereby decreasing the delay. This process is called cloning since we are generating two new flops with same functionality as A.

**Retiming** : Sequential circuits can be optimised by retiming. The combinational section of the circuitry is unaffected as it only rearranges the registers in the circuit.
It is a powerful sequential optimization technique used to move registers across the combinational logic or to optimize the number of registers to improve performance via power-delay trade-off, without changing the input-output behavior of the circuit.

**Example 1**
Here flop is inferred in output 
```ruby
module dff_const1(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
	always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
	begin
		if(reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else
			q <= 1'b1;
	end
endmodule
```

# Day 4 Gate level simulation(GLS), Blocking Vs Non Blocking and Synthesis Simulation mismatch

 <details>
 <summary>Gate level synthesis,blocking vs non blocking , Synthesis simulation mismatch</summary>

 **Gate level Synthesis** 
 Gate-level simulation is a fundamental component of VLSI design verification. This simulation technique involves creating models for the behavior of digital circuits at the gate level, representing individual logic gates and flip-flops. Through gate-level simulations, designers can gain insight into how the circuit will respond to various inputs and clock signals. By simulating signal propagation through gates, it becomes possible to validate the accuracy of logic functionality, pinpoint timing discrepancies, and detect potential issues like glitches or hazards.GLS generates the simulation output by running test bench with the netlist generated from the synthesis of design.

**Why GLS** 

- To verify logic correctness of design after synthesis

- If GLS is run with delay annotion then it can be used for timing analysis 

- To identify errors that might occur due to signal progation delay.

- As Design become more and more complex it becomes difficult to predict their behaviour accurately,GLS offers a comprehensive and a detailed view of circuit operation

**Synthesis Simulation Mismatch** 

Synthesis simulation mismatch denotes the disparities between the anticipated behavior of a circuit as simulated during design and its real-world performance after fabrication. This discrepancy is attributed to factors such as process variations, parasitic effects, and inaccuracies in simulation models. It's a critical concern to guarantee the functional alignment of the manufactured circuit with its intended design.

Synthesis simulation mismatched are mainly caused because of the following reasons 

- Missing sensitivity list
- Blocking vs Non Blocking assignments
- Non standard verilog code

**Missing sensitivity list**
The absence of a complete sensitivity list in VLSI design can give rise to problems. In hardware description languages (HDL) like Verilog, a sensitivity list is utilized to specify the inputs that should activate the execution of a specific process or code block. Inadequate or missing signals in the sensitivity list can lead to inaccurate or unforeseen behavior of the circuit during synthesis or simulation. Ensuring an accurate representation of inputs impacting the logic within a process is vital.

As the synthesizer does not look for sensitivity list and it looks only statements in the procedural block , it infers correct circuit and if we simulate the netlist code , there will be synthesis simulation mismatch. In to order tackle this issue this issue it is important to check the behaviour of the circuit first and then match it with the expected output seen in the simulation. 

**Blocking Vs Non Blocking Assignments**

*Blocking statements* are the type of assignment statements in Hardware Description Language. These assignments are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the code. The next statement will wait for the current one to finish.

Example of blocking assignment 
```ruby
always @posedge(clk) begin
	a = b;
	d = c;
end
```
Improper use of blocking assignments in the always block can lead to synthesis simulation mismatch 

*Non Blocking statements* are also a type of assgnment statements in HDL. These assignments are executed parallely, and the updates to the values  take effect at the end of the time step.

Example of non blocking assignment

```ruby
always @posedge(clk) begin
	a <= b;
	d <= c;
end
```
Inside always block it is always a good practise to use non blocking assignment statements

	assign y = sel?i1:i0;
endmodule
```

In this we see that when select line is 0 , Output follows i0 and when select line is 1 output follows i1. This is same for both the simulations so there is no mismatch.

**Example 2**
Consider a example of mux.In this always block is triggered only when the select line is changed.
```ruby
module bad_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);
	always @ (sel)
	begin
		if(sel)
			y <= i1;
		else 
			y <= i0;

In this we can see that there is simulation synthesis mismatch , in the RTL design simulation we see that output is changing only when select line is changing but thats not the correct functionality of a mux , the output should change when either the input or select line is changed , this is reflected in the netlist simulation.

**Example 3**
Consider a example of mux.In this the always block is triggered when there is a change in either input or select line. 
```ruby
module good_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output reg y);

This a combinational circuit of or and and gate , in which the output of or gate is given as input to the and gate as shown in the figure , but in the RTL Design code blocking statements are used to define these operations in reverse direction(These statements are executed sequentially) so the and gate is getting input from the  previous output of or gate which acts as imaginary flop. As a result we are getting a different waveform in RTL design simulation , the correct waveform is  obtained  while doing netlist simulation. This causes Synthesis Simulation mismatch. This can be overcome by using non blocking assignment statements in the always block.
