# Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
 Register-transfer level (RTL): It is a design abstraction that models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the data flow between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. In RTL code we write code for combinational and sequential circuits like that of HDL, and VHDL.

 
Testbench: It is a program written in any language for the purposes of exercising and verifying the functional correctness of the hardware model as coded. We write this testbench in Verilog. Using this testbench we apply a stimulus to the RTL Design and verify its functionality by checking the output.

Simulator: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs. The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

 <summary>Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave</summary>

 We performed all the lab examples on the Linux operating system.

 Iverilog: Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language compiler that generates netlists in the desired format (EDIF). It supports the 1995, 2001, and 2005 versions of the standard, portions of SystemVerilog, and some extensions.

 Gtkwave: GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix, Win32, and Mac OSX which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

 We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice. 

 Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog. 
 
 The syntax of the code is: iverilog RTL_design_code Testbench
