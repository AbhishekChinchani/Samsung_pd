# Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators</summary>
	 
 **RTL**: It is a design abstraction that models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the data flow between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. In RTL code we write code for combinational and sequential circuits like that of HDL, and VHDL.

 
**Testbench**: It is a program written in any language for the purposes of exercising and verifying the functional correctness of the hardware model as coded. We write this testbench in Verilog. Using this testbench we apply a stimulus to the RTL Design and verify its functionality by checking the output.

**Simulator**: RTL design is checked for adherence to its design specification using simulation by giving simple inputs. The tool used for this purpose is called Simulator. The simulator looks at the input changes and then evaluates the output. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.  

</details>	
 <details>
 <summary>Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave</summary>

 We performed all the lab examples on the Linux operating system.

 **Iverilog**: Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language compiler that generates netlists in the desired format (EDIF). It supports the 1995, 2001, and 2005 versions of the standard, portions of SystemVerilog, and some extensions.

 **Gtkwave**: GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix, Win32, and Mac OSX which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

 We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes for practice. 

 Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog. 
 
 The syntax of the code is: iverilog RTL_design_code Testbench

 <summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

 **Synthesis**: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

 **Yosys** : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

**Verification of synthesized design** : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

**Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells** :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power. Narrow transistors are other way around. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit. Keeping in view of previous observations of faster vs slower cells,to avoid hold time violations, larger circuits, sluggish circuits, we offer guidance to synthesizer in the form of Constraints.

<summary>Labs on Yosys </summary>
 We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX. 
 
 **Procedure** : First we need to read the liberty file using the code
 
 **read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 Then we need read the RTL Design code

 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 After this we need to perform synthesis 

 **synth -top <instance_name>**
 
 generating netlist

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form using the **show** command

# Day-2-Introduction to Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and flip flop coding 

 <details>
 <summary>Introduction to timing libraries</summary>

 **Timing File** consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was  **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8**, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical, temperature is 25C, and 1v8 represents the voltage.

Below is the screenshot of a standard library file

<img width = "1085" alt="std_lib" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/8cc214f938b327466e90dde958d486b2d36f7b9d/day%232/lib_file.png">

The timing File also consists of the technology used for standard cells as in the above example it is **CMOS**, it also specifies the delay model, unit of time, unit of voltage, unit of resistance, and many other units. 

For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters are mentioned. For example, consider the below screenshot the gate mentioned in the screenshot consists of 5 inputs so there will be 2^5 i.e 32 combinations, and for all the combinations power, delay, value, and all the features are mentioned in it.

<img  width="1085" alt="std_lib" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/522961b79bd941674795678a161f1ee5465e484c/day%232/a21110.png">

The timing file consists of many different variations of the same gate cells.

Below image shows the comparison of the power consumption of different flavours of the same gate

 <summary>Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis</summary>
	
 **Hierarchical synthesis** : The basic flow of hierarchical design is simple… Dividing a design into multiple blocks (sometimes referred to as sub-chips, sub-blocks, modules, hierarchical blocks, etc.). Designers can work on the blocks separately and in parallel from RTL through physical implementation. Hierarchial design has blocks, subblocks in an hierarchy.

 Consider a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of a **and** gate and other of a **or** gate. Below is the RTL Design code of multimodule.
 


```ruby
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a&b;
endmodule


module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
wire net1;
sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
```
The Schmetic of the multiple  model is as shown in the below figure.
<img  width="1085" alt="hand_writ_ckt" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/dela.png">

When we perform synthesis in yosys it generates the following schematic instead of the  above  schematic
<img  width="1085" alt="hier" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/hier_sch.png">

The yosys considers the module hierarchy and does mapping according to the instantiation.The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules

```ruby
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	  input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	  wire net1;
	 output y;
  sub_module1 u1 (.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1) );
  sub_module2 u2 (.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
 wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
 input a;
 input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (.A(_1_),.B(_0_),.X(_2_));
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
input a;
input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _3_ (.A(_1_),.SLEEP(_0_),.X(_2_) );
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
In the netlist we can observe that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are getting created i.e submodules are getting instanstiated not the gate cells


**Flat synthesis** : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened  out and there is a single module in the netlist i.e the gates are instantiated directly instead of submodules. We apply flat synthesis on the same  design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows

**read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 **synth -top <instance_name>**

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
 **flatten**

**write_verilog -noattr <File_name>**

The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist is shown in the below image , Here submodules u1 and u2 are flattened 
<img  width="1085" alt="hier" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/flat_sch.png">

The netlist code of the flattened synthesis is as follows
```ruby

module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	 wire _0_;
	 wire _1_;
	 wire _2_;
	 wire _3_;
	 wire _4_;
	 wire _5_;
	 input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	 wire net1;
	 wire \u1.a ;
	 wire \u1.b ;
	 wire \u1.y ;
	 wire \u2.a ;
	 wire \u2.b ;
	 wire \u2.y ;
	output y;
	 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _6_ (
	  .A(_1_),
	 .B(_0_),
	 .X(_2_)
	);
	 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _7_ (
	  .A(_4_),
	  .SLEEP(_3_),
	  .X(_5_)
	 );
	 assign _4_ = \u2.b ;
	 assign _3_ = \u2.a ;
	 assign \u2.y  = _5_;
	 assign \u2.a  = net1;
	 assign \u2.b  = c;
	 assign y = \u2.y ;
	 assign _1_ = \u1.b ;
	 assign _0_ = \u1.a ;
	 assign \u1.y  = _2_;
	 assign \u1.a  = a;
	 assign \u1.b  = b;
	 assign net1 = \u1.y ;
	endmodule
```
We can see that there is a single module which consist of the gate level instantion of the two submodules .


Performing Synthesis at sub_module level is one of the good practises for the massive designs as it simplifies the debugging process . It is also helpful in cases where there many instances of the same module , Instead of synthesizing all the instances we can synthesize one and duplicate it for others and stitch them together. Here is the synthesized circuit and netlist image of the sub_module1 

<img  width="1085" alt="sub_module1" src="https://github.com/AbhishekChinchani/Samsung_pd/blob/d014884bf2fa07de0fa6c458307678c51a5b9f25/day%232/sub_module1_sch.png">

 <summary>Flop coding</summary>

 **Flop**: They are digital electronic circuits that are used to store information in bits as they have two stable states.Even though the input is not stable it gives stable output.
 
 **Why Flop**
 In a combinational circuit, the output changes after the propagation delay of the circuit once inputs are changed. During the propagation of data, if there are different paths with different propagation delays, there might be a chance of getting a *glitch* at the output. *glitch* is a signal value pulse that occurs when a logic level changes two or more times over a short period.

If there are multiple combinational circuits in the design, the occurances of glitches are more thereby making the output unstable.
To curb this drawback, we are going for flops to store the data from the cominational circuits. When a flop is used, the output of combinational circuit is stored in it and it is propagated only at the posedge or negedge of the clock so that the next combinational circuit gets a glitch free input thereby stabilising the output.

We use initialize signals or control pins called set and reset on a flop to initialize the flop, other wise a garbage value to sent out to the next combinational circuit.

**Asynchronous Reset D Flop**
Here the output signal goes low when the reset signal is high , it does not wait for the clock's edge(positive or negative edge ).i.e irrespective of the clock output changes
RTL Design code
```ruby
 module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
	always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
	begin
		if(async_reset)
			q <= 1'b0;
		else	
			q <= d;
	end
endmodule
```
